 ///// VORTEX FILE BINDER  /////
///////////////////////////////

Version: 1.1

Lanuage: Visual Basic (.NET Framework 4.8.1)

Purpose: Simple file-binding utility which aids in laundering a payload silently onto a system.

Packing method: Vortex uses XOR encryption (boolean-logic cipher) to encrypt each payload attached
                to the initial stub; additionally, the encrypted payloads are also wrapped in BASE-64
                encoding.
